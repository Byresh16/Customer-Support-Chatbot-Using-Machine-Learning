# Customer Support Chatbot Using Machine Learning

An AI-powered chatbot designed to automate customer support by handling FAQs, resolving common issues, and escalating complex queries. Built with **Machine Learning** for intent classification and **NLP** for smart responses, it can be integrated into websites or applications to provide instant support.

## 🚀 Features

* Intent classification using ML models
* FAQ and knowledge-base support with semantic search
* Multi-turn conversations with context handling
* Fallback to human agent when confidence is low
* Easy integration into web or mobile applications

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a query
2. The ML model classifies intent (e.g., billing, orders, technical)
3. Relevant answer is fetched using NLP/semantic search
4. Response is displayed to the user, or escalated if uncertain

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Machine Learning (scikit-learn / PyTorch / TensorFlow)**
* **NLP (NLTK / SpaCy / Hugging Face Transformers)**
* **FastAPI / Flask** for backend
* **SQLite / JSON** for storing FAQs and logs
